# Medical Question-Answer Dataset Curation
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides users through the process of curating a dataset specifically designed for training generative AI models in the medical domain. The tutorial utilizes Label Studio, a versatile tool for data labeling, to facilitate the creation of a question-answer dataset aimed at medical applications.

## Notebooks
- [Medical Q&A Example](./Medical-QA-Example.ipynb) Label Studio project setup and data processing
- [Fine Tune Llama 3](./Fine_tune_Llama_3_8b_MedChat.ipynb) Notebook to fine-tune Llama 3 on a Colab T4. 

## Features
- Label Studio Setup: Step-by-step instructions on setting up Label Studio projects for syntheticly generated Q&A datasets.
