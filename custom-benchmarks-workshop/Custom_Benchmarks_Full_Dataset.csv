10,"i have a question for humansignal. i am a reviewer. when i accept a fix an annotation, how does that impact the agreement and review scores for the annotator? if i am fixing it, i would still want it to appear that this was initially a mistake","When you click **Fix + Accept**, Label Studio records a review with `fixed_annotation_history`.  
- _Review Score_ treats Fix + Accept as an accepted review (accepted = true), so it counts toward the reviewer’s acceptance rate.  
- _Performance Score_ instead sums the actual review scores: for Fix + Accept it uses the matching score between your fixed result and the original annotation (via `ReviewStats.score`), which will be < 1 if you corrected a mistake.  

**Further information**

2. How Fix + Accept is scored: [get_review_score implementation](Label Studio code  
3. Review vs Performance Score overview: [Annotator performance dashboard](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_annotator.html)","Reviewer logic:

- When you fix an annotation, the annotator’s original mistake is still recorded.
- Agreement scores use the original (pre‑fix) label.
- The corrected label becomes the new reference.

**Further information**  
1. https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/review
","When you fix and accept an annotation, the scoring impact depends on your workflow:

**To track the initial mistake:**
1. First, **reject** the annotation with a reason (this logs the error).
2. Then create a corrected annotation or reassign the task.

**Direct fixing:**
- Accepting a fixed annotation may not automatically flag it as incorrect in agreement metrics.
- The corrected version becomes the ground truth.
