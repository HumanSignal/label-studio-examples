4,"I don't see a button called ""action"" in data manager. Where is it?","The ""Actions"" button appears in the Data Manager’s toolbar only after you select one or more tasks. It’s added if your role has bulk action permissions (which you do as OWNER). So, simply select some tasks via their checkboxes, and the ""Actions"" dropdown should become visible.

10,"i have a question for humansignal. i am a reviewer. when i accept a fix an annotation, how does that impact the agreement and review scores for the annotator? if i am fixing it, i would still want it to appear that this was initially a mistake","When you click **Fix + Accept**, Label Studio records a review with `fixed_annotation_history`.  
- _Review Score_ treats Fix + Accept as an accepted review (accepted = true), so it counts toward the reviewer’s acceptance rate.  
- _Performance Score_ instead sums the actual review scores: for Fix + Accept it uses the matching score between your fixed result and the original annotation (via `ReviewStats.score`), which will be < 1 if you corrected a mistake.
